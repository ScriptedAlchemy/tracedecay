//! Block-STM inspired parallel transaction execution.
//!
//! Executes a batch of operations in parallel optimistically, validates for conflicts,
//! and re-executes conflicting transactions. This is inspired by Aptos Block-STM and
//! provides significant speedup for batch-heavy workloads like ETL imports.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! The execution follows four phases:
//!
//! 1. **Optimistic Execution**: Execute all operations in parallel without locking.
//!    Each operation tracks its read and write sets.
//!
//! 2. **Validation**: Check if any read was invalidated by a concurrent write from
//!    an earlier transaction in the batch.
//!
//! 3. **Re-execution**: Re-execute invalidated transactions with knowledge of
//!    their dependencies.
//!
//! 4. **Commit**: Apply all writes in transaction order for determinism.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! | Conflict Rate | Expected Speedup |
//! |---------------|------------------|
//! | 0% | 3-4x on 4 cores |
//! | <10% | 2-3x |
//! | >30% | Falls back to sequential |
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use grafeo_engine::transaction::parallel::{ParallelExecutor, BatchRequest};
//!
//! let executor = ParallelExecutor::new(4); // 4 workers
//!
//! let batch = BatchRequest::new(vec![
//!     "CREATE (n:Person {id: 1})",
//!     "CREATE (n:Person {id: 2})",
//!     "CREATE (n:Person {id: 3})",
//! ]);
//!
//! let result = executor.execute_batch(batch, |_idx, _op, _result| {
//!     // execute each operation against the store
//! });
//! assert!(result.all_succeeded());
//! ```
